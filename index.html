                <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Hi, I'm Cooper, I'm 20 years old, and I'm currently a major in video game desing and development at New England Institute of Technology. I'm from Boston, Massachusetts, I came to NEIT because I want to make games in groups and get a more "official" start in my career. 
                    I got into gaming at a very young age like most people, watching my dad play world of warcraft is one of my first memories. My favorite games of all time are, <i>Fallout: New Vegas</i>, <i>Final Fantasy 16</i>, and <i>God of War: Ragnarok</i>
                    However my passion for the art of game development and the respect I have for the industry continued to grow alongside my increasingly problematic gaming addiction. 
                    I spent most of my time as a kid watching retrospectives on the history of Video Games, from YouTube videos about the conception of companies and consoles to more direct sources like interviews with developers. Later, I would go on to get much more into film making and photography and somewhere along the way I forgot about game development, 
                    I became extreamly interested in the effect a story can have on a person, 
                    how it can change them, what it could make them think about, how does someone's personal experience change how they view art? That last question stuck with me especially because everytime I would go to play a story driven game I realized I had direct control over how the story unfolded to various extents. With this in the back of my mind I began to feel more and more limited by the medium of film,
                and after playing <i>God of War: Ragnarok</i> it was clear to me that gaming is finally reaching a point to where we can have deeper and more thought provoking themes than the next "big event movie" hollywood is producing and on top of that, the cinematographgy is often more interesting, the stories are longer, and the audience has a much more important role in the story.
            <br> From that moment I dedicated the next 2 years to learning everthing I possibly could for free about game development. People say theres a lot, those people are liars. Most of the information out there is the same basic functionallity needed for any game repeated by hundreds of people. I learned a lot about game development in that time was, I need more people to work with, and I need a seasoned professional to talk to directly when I have issues, above all I just needed to know more. That is what brought me to NEIT, their game development course offered me everything I could have ever hoped for in terms of access to industry equipment and professors who not only knew the material but lived it. My experience here so far has been better than I could've ever hoped for, as of right now I still find the time to work on personal projects but I'm sure that free time will slowly dimish the longer I'm here. But as long as I can make games I enjoy and I find some sort of fufilment in making, I can be happy.</p>
